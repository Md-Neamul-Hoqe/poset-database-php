Speedup Serial MATLAB Code:
1. Use The Latest version.
2. Use Built-in functions and data-types. [Default multitheaded functions are: fft [first fourier transform], eig, svd and sort]
3. Use Efficient Programming Practices.
	Use Functions instead of scripts.
	pre-allocate memory [like array]
	Use new variable instead of existing variable. 
	Use matrix and vector instead of loops.
	Avoid printing too much data on the screen, reuse existing graphics handles.
	Avoid programmatic use of cd, addpath and rmpath.
4. Load common variables from a file instead of executing code to generate them repeatedly.
5. Generate 'mex' C/C++ or CUDA code from a function
